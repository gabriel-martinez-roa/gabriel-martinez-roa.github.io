I study this phenomenon as a Bayesian persuasion game with multiple senders that have partial control over the beliefs of a receiver. The receiver knows the signal chosen by all senders but randomly observes the realization of only one such signal. Senders can pool their signals, so the receiver is uncertain about the informativeness of the message received. This uncertainty may incentivize a sender to provide more or less information compared to the benchmark without uncertainty about the sender. The central insight is that each sender’s signal is chosen to affect the average correlation between messages and the state of the world, given the communication strategies of other senders. I derive policy recommendations to improve the quality of the information on platforms like social media.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion in the Digital Age (Draft coming soon)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566157745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566157745,"objectID":"ac7e3636372eec50b11d23784759b957","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/ddm/","publishdate":"2019-08-18T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ddm/","section":"publication","summary":"Most financial assets are traded in multiple trading venues. We study a model of imperfectly-competitive trading where agents have multiple opportunities to trade risky assets. We consider decentralized markets: that is, there are coexisting exchanges for many assets and any number of strategic traders. We characterize equilibrium dynamics of prices, trades, and price impact. Markets with the same prices, allocations, and price impact may differ in their dynamic efficiency properties depending on the characteristics of traders and their participation in different exchanges. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions - on trader participation alone - for markets to be dynamically efficient as the number of rounds grows to infinity. Decentralized markets for a single asset (or, more generally, standardized assets) are always dynamically efficient. For assets traded at low frequencies, even markets that are not dynamically efficient can give rise to higher total welfare than the centralized market. Increasing trading frequency can lower welfare due to the interaction of price impact and market incompleteness (i.e., limited participation in the exchanges).","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Trading in Decentralized Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Natalia Serna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557431345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557431345,"objectID":"f653017d08ea8deea98bccc2f9e3f047","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/cap_ffs/","publishdate":"2019-05-09T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cap_ffs/","section":"publication","summary":"In the Colombian health care system, the government regulates the relationship between insurers and hospitals by fixing a menu of contracts from which they can choose for the provision of health services.

In capitation contracts hospitals are paid a fixed amount per patient, regardless of treatment; while in FFS contracts, insurers fully pay the hospitals for each service.
