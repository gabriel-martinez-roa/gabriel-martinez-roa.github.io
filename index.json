Whether it is a news report, an article in a magazine or social media, a marketing campaign, a policy evaluation, etc, they usually have data or experiments that support their statements. However, for many decision makers, it is often hard or impossible to fully understand the details of how the study was designed, the power of its tests, its external validity, etc. In general, it is unclear the message informativeness, thus how to respond to its recommendation. I model this uncertainty about the signal that a sender uses to persuade a receiver. I consider both exogenous uncertainty and asymmetric information, and show that compared to the benchmark of Kamenika and Gentskow (2011), this uncertainty may benefit some types of senders and harm others. The amount of information provided increases at moderate levels of uncertainty, but in contrast with the cheap talk literature, large levels of skepticism can lead to completely uninformative signals. Finally, I complement Bergemann and Morris' (2017) framework of information design to connect my setup with existing literature on limited commitment (Frechette et al, 2017 and Min, 2017), and persuasion with multiple senders (Kamenika and Gentzkow, 2018 a,b and Li and Morgan, 2018).","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion with Signal Uncertainty (JMP)","type":"publication"}]
