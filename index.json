I extend the classic model of Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011) by allowing the receiver to have uncertainty about the source of information, and study how this change affects the incentives to provide information and the scope for successfully convincing a decision maker. In the classic model, the commitment to reveal the results of an experiment implies that recommendations are always followed in equilibrium. I show, however, that if the sender cannot commit to revealing some of his private information, the receiver may not follow the recommendations in equilibrium. The partial commitment creates uncertainty regarding the quality of the signal and may obfuscate communication. For generic receiver's preferences, I show that, regardless of the the diversity and quality of information available, if the frequency of deceptive information is high, even unbiased senders will be unable to persuade the receiver. I moreover argue that presenting sources with opposing agendas without requiring them to disclose their bias is less informative than having a single source of information with a known bias. Indeed, once the bias of the source (or, in general, its incentives to provide information) is known, other sources of uncertainty are irrelevant to the receiver; for example how informed the sender is.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion with Source Uncertainty (JMP)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539892145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539892145,"objectID":"ac7e3636372eec50b11d23784759b957","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/ddm/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ddm/","section":"publication","summary":"Most financial assets are traded in multiple trading venues. We study a model of imperfectly-competitive trading where agents have multiple opportunities to trade risky assets. We consider decentralized markets: that is, there are coexisting exchanges for many assets and any number of strategic traders. We characterize equilibrium dynamics of prices, trades, and price impact. Markets with the same prices, allocations, and price impact may differ in their dynamic efficiency properties depending on the characteristics of traders and their participation in different exchanges. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions - on trader participation alone - for markets to be dynamically efficient as the number of rounds grows to infinity. Decentralized markets for a single asset (or, more generally, standardized assets) are always dynamically efficient. For assets traded at low frequencies, even markets that are not dynamically efficient can give rise to higher total welfare than the centralized market. Increasing trading frequency can lower welfare due to the interaction of price impact and market incompleteness (i.e., limited participation in the exchanges).","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Trading in Decentralized Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Clark","Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Nicholas Tenev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539892145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539892145,"objectID":"86eb563fbefebea1e182bd4ddac41b4f","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/cbias/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cbias/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a setting in which a sender tries to convince a receiver to take the correct action, which both prefer. The receiver is unsure if the sender is informed, causing the receiver to doubt messages that differ from his own beliefsâ€”a rational confirmation bias. Anticipating this, an informed sender may strategically feign agreement with the receiver in hope of demonstrating a similarity that might build trust. If lying is costly, then as beliefs diverge, the sender will quit trying to influence the receiver, creating a separation in the set of equilibrium messages. Our results give insight into the formation of echo chambers and the perceived polarization of dialogue when there may not actually be polarization in beliefs.","tags":[],"title":"Factual Disagreement with Endogenous Confirmation Bias","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek","Ji-Hee Yoon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539892145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539892145,"objectID":"cc6b12892d0ecf610206f42b2bc2c1dd","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/dg/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dg/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper examines games among groups of players who act non-cooperatively. Players can be members of multiple groups (contracts), and their payoffs exhibit externalities both within and across groups. We characterize equilibrium for games in which the payoff externalities among groups are symmetric for each player. We characterize when bilateral vs. multilateral contracts maximize total welfare. Furthermore, we show that creating private clubs, in which a subset of group members signs a separate contract, can improve welfare by reducing negative strategic externalities in the larger contract.","tags":[],"title":"Games with Multilateral Contracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I can add some content here\nWhat if it is super [long]https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/home/posts/\nand with links\nif it goes on and on?\nwhat happens next?\n","date":1539138098,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539138098,"objectID":"572d64580796b9adfd8e1de2b03683b2","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/post/econ101/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T21:21:38-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/econ101/","section":"post","summary":"I can add some content here\nWhat if it is super [long]https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/home/posts/\nand with links\nif it goes on and on?\nwhat happens next?","tags":[],"title":"Fall 2014 - (302) Intermediate Macroeconomics (Undergradiate) -    UW-Madison ","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"I can add some content here\nWhat if it is super [long]https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/home/posts/\nand with links\nif it goes on and on?\nwhat happens next?\n","date":1539138098,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539138098,"objectID":"bed89c1c8ef2a14f8de94ff0921c9b0e","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/post/my-article-name/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T21:21:38-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/my-article-name/","section":"post","summary":"I can add some content here\nWhat if it is super [long]https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/home/posts/\nand with links\nif it goes on and on?\nwhat happens next?","tags":[],"title":"Spring 2015 - (101) [Principles of Microeconomics (Undergradiate)  -    UW-Madison ","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539137762,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539137762,"objectID":"9ebb016b8f62ea5c22d5e4ba085ce665","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/project/my-project-name/","publishdate":"2018-10-09T21:16:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project-name/","section":"project","summary":"Here is where I can add content","tags":[],"title":"Econ 101","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536437036,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536437036,"objectID":"6e40d8854f5030e0c02d6572039d1054","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/talk/midwest-theory-vandervilt/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T15:03:56-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/midwest-theory-vandervilt/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion with Signal Uncertainty","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek","Ji-Hee Yoon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"030d49ded4c60baabba84eef9f81fe76","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/dg_c/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dg_c/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Games among Groups","type":"publication"}]
