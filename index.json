We study a model of imperfectly-competitive trading where agents have multiple opportunities to trade risky assets. We consider decentralized markets: that is, there are coexisting exchanges for many assets and any number of strategic traders. We characterize equilibrium dynamics of prices, trades, and price impact. Markets with the same prices, allocations, and price impact may differ in their dynamic efficiency properties depending on the characteristics of traders and their participation in different exchanges. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions - on trader participation alone - for markets to be dynamically efficient as the number of rounds grows to infinity. Decentralized markets for a single asset (or, more generally, standardized assets) are always dynamically efficient. For assets traded at low frequencies, even markets that are not dynamically efficient can give rise to higher total welfare than the centralized market. Increasing trading frequency can lower welfare due to the interaction of price impact and market incompleteness (i.e., limited participation in the exchanges).","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Trading in Decentralized Markets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1562701745,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562701745,"objectID":"65b5785fae437ebd6047c556ec48229f","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/jmp/","publishdate":"2019-07-09T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jmp/","section":"publication","summary":"In digital platforms, agents have vast access to information, but the quality of it is usually unclear to them. I study this phenomenon as a Bayesian persuasion game with multiple senders that have partial control over the beliefs of a receiver. The receiver knows the signal chosen by all senders but randomly observes the realization of only one such signal. Senders can pool their signals, so the receiver is uncertain about the informativeness of the message received. This uncertainty may incentivize a sender to provide more or less information compared to the benchmark without uncertainty. The central insight is that each sender's optimal signal is chosen to affect the average signal conditional on the actions of other senders. I apply this framework in some important examples to derive policy recommendations for information platforms like social media.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion in the Digital Age","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Natalia Serna"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1557431345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557431345,"objectID":"f653017d08ea8deea98bccc2f9e3f047","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/cap_ffs/","publishdate":"2019-05-09T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cap_ffs/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Hospital Incentives under Capitation and Fee-for-Service  Contracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Nicholas Tenev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1554839345,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554839345,"objectID":"86eb563fbefebea1e182bd4ddac41b4f","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/cbias/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cbias/","section":"publication","summary":"How much attention should you pay those you disagree with on factual matters?Not  as  much—they  are  less  likely  to  be  right.

Players can be members of multiple groups (contracts), and their payoffs exhibit externalities both within and across groups. We characterize equilibrium for games in which the payoff externalities among groups are symmetric for each player. We characterize when bilateral vs. multilateral contracts maximize total welfare. Furthermore, we show that creating private clubs, in which a subset of group members signs a separate contract, can improve welfare by reducing negative strategic externalities in the larger contract.","tags":[],"title":"Games with Multilateral Contracts","type":"publication"}]
