Whether it is a news report, an article in a magazine or social media, a marketing campaign, a policy evaluation, etc, they usually have data or experiments that support their statements. However, for many decision makers, it is often hard or impossible to fully understand the details of how the study was designed, the power of its tests, or its external validity. In a model of bayesian persuasion, I consider a receiver with uncertainty about the signal that a sender uses to persuade. Both exogenous and endogenous uncertainty can be accommodated. I show how this asymmetry in the understanding of the signal may benefit some types of senders and harm others. As in a lemons market, asymmetric persuasion is in general good for low types, bad for high types and can lead to no information transmitted in equilibrium. Finally, I show that uncertainty imposes endogenous constraints on the posteriors that an information designer can implement.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion with Signal Uncertainty (JMP)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek","Ji-Hee Yoon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536436145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536436145,"objectID":"cc6b12892d0ecf610206f42b2bc2c1dd","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/dg/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dg/","section":"publication","summary":"We study games where players’ belong to one or multiple groups. Their payoffs are a function only of the actions of the players in their groups and can sign contracts with them. This is, players choose contingent schedules of their actions as a function of other players’ actions. Assuming quadratic payoff functions, we characterize the equilibrium in linear contracts where players correctly anticipate the strategic impact they have on other players. The game structure endogenously defines a weighted, directed network among players, with weights given by the optimal equation of residual strategic impact across counterparts. We provide comparative statics for a general class of games, those where players’ groups form a complete network with respect to the externalities they have on each other, the strength of their connections, the number of players in the network and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for large games to be efficient.","tags":[],"title":"Contracts among Groups","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536436145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536436145,"objectID":"ac7e3636372eec50b11d23784759b957","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/ddm/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ddm/","section":"publication","summary":"we study the dynamic behavior of decentralized markets. Using a flexible framework we consider the standard double auction linear pricing model to define market clearing exchanges that are interconnected via the assets they trade and the players that participate in them. This is, we consider market interactions in a hyper-graph, which allows for multilateral interactions and arbitrary connections between exchanges. We are interested in the efficiency properties of decentralized structures with frequent trading. Likewise, we explore open questions about the network effects of financial inclusion, innovation and over-the-counter trading of standardized assets.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic Decentralized Markets","type":"publication"}]
