Within the framework of Bayesian persuasion, I consider a receiver with uncertainty about the signal received. Whether the uncertainty is due to exogenous noise, like processing limitations, or due to the sender having private information about her preferences or the underlying state of the world, I show that uncertainty imposes further constraints on the posteriors that can be induced, beyond Bayesian plausibility (see Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011). As in the market for lemons, the fact that the sender knows more about the signal than the receiver is, in general, good for bad types, but bad for good types. From the receiver's perspective, though moderate skepticism incentivizes the provision of better information; extreme incredulity may eliminate any incentive to provide information.","tags":[],"title":"Bayesian Persuasion with Signal Uncertainty (JMP)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek","Ji-Hee Yoon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536436145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536436145,"objectID":"cc6b12892d0ecf610206f42b2bc2c1dd","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/dg/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dg/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper explores how players incentives differ when they interact as individuals versus as part of a group. We consider games where players choose contracts that take the form of supply functions. Each agent has access to fully contingent contracts and their payoff depends on the actions or their peers in each of the groups they belong to. In equilibrium, players equalize the strategic impact of their actions across games and may benefit from creating private clubs where only a subset of them interact. In our framework, interactions need not be restricted to bilateral, or centralized. Leveraging on the linearity of contracts, we can study games with arbitrary multilateral groups. We find conditions for contracts of intermediate size to be optimal, and provide sufficient conditions for large games to converge to efficient.","tags":[],"title":"Decentralized Games with Multilateral Contracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Marzena Rostek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536436145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536436145,"objectID":"ac7e3636372eec50b11d23784759b957","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/ddm/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ddm/","section":"publication","summary":"Many financial assets are traded increasingly in a decentralized way, via multiple trading venues. While this enhances access to financial instruments, the liquidity and allocation efficiency of the network can be worsened. In this paper, we consider a flexible model of decentralized markets with frequent trading. We extend the CARA-Normal framework of multilateral trading with demand schedules to study equilibrium in arbitrary networks of exchanges with frequent trading. With enough opportunities to diversify their portfolio, the equilibrium is dynamically constrained efficient. We characterize these constrains solely on agents’ access to exchanges and their interconnectedness. Centralized markets can be outperformed by fragmented markets if trading is un-frequent, and by highly interconnected exchanges when trading is frequent. Finally, we explore how financial inclusion and financial innovation affect welfare.","tags":[],"title":"Efficiency of Decentralized Markets with Frequent Trading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Clark","Gabriel Martinez-Roa","Nicholas Tenev"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536436145,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536436145,"objectID":"86eb563fbefebea1e182bd4ddac41b4f","permalink":"https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/publication/cbias/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T14:49:05-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cbias/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider a setting in which a sender tries to convince a receiver to take the correct action, which both prefer. The receiver is unsure if the sender is informed, causing the receiver to doubt messages that differ from his own beliefs—a rational confirmation bias. Anticipating this, an informed sender may strategically feign agreement with the receiver in hope of demonstrating a similarity that might build trust. If lying is costly, then as beliefs diverge, the sender will quit trying to influence the receiver, creating a separation in the set of equilibrium messages. Our results give insight into the formation of echo chambers and the perceived polarization of dialogue when there may not actually be polarization in beliefs.","tags":[],"title":"Factual Disagreement with Endogenous Confirmation Bias","type":"publication"}]
