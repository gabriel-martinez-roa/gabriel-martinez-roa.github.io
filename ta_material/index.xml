      <description>Course Description This introductory course was taught by professor Ricardo Serrano-Padial during his time in UW-Madison. The TA material found here was put together by several TA&amp;rsquo;s. The formatting is mine. Students learned the core concepts in economics starting from demand and supply and exploring deeper into producer and consumer theory. Students learned both about competitive, well-functioning markets as well as settings where markets fail or are characterized by market power.</description>
